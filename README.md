Hey! I'm Hailey and I do math and other fun stuff.
I'm currently learning a bunch of different programming languages to help me with research and fuel my own fascinations.

I'm feeling rather dihedral today, $\langle r,s \vert r^2=s^n=1,rs=s^{-1}r \rangle$.

My pfp was drawn by my good friend [hunny_lemon](https://x.com/hunny_lemmonn/status/1743874309397827988?s=46&t=MephgeGR1_V1n_8F-F3N4Q "Give him love!!"). <3!
